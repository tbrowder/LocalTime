=head1 NAME

B<LocalTime> - A wrapper of class B<DateTime> with varied formatters depending on time zone entry

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>

use LocalTime;

=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<LocalTime> is a wrapper class holding an instance of the Raku
B<DateTime> class. It was created to either add a local timezone (TZ)
abbreviation to a time string or show either none or other TZ
information depending on the use (or non-use) of the named variable
C<:tz-abbrev>. Following are the formatting effects of the various
input conditions:

=head3 class DateTime

=begin item
The default format for C<DateTime>:

=begin code
$ say DateTime.new: :2024year;
2024-01-01T00:00:00Z
=end code
=end item

=head3 class LocalTime

=begin item
The default format for C<LocalTime> with no time zone entry:

=begin code
$ say LocalTime.new(:2024year);
2024-01-01T00:00:00 # <== note no trailing 'Z'
=end code
=end item

=begin item
The default format for C<LocalTime> with 'CST' entered:

=begin code
$ say LocalTime.new(:2024year, :tz-abbrev<CST>);
2024-01-01T00:00:00 CST
=end code
=end item

=begin item
The format for C<LocalTime> with a non-US TZ abbreviation entered:

=begin code
$ say LocalTime.new(:2024year, :tz-abbrev<XYT>);
2024-01-01T00:00:00 XYT
=end code
=end item

=begin item
The format for C<LocalTime> with an empty C<:tz-abbrev> named argument
entered:

=begin code
$ say LocalTime.new(:2024year, :tz-abbrev);
2024-01-01T00:00:00 Local Time (UTC -6 hrs)
=end code
=end item

Note for US TZ entries the user can enter either '*st' or '*dt' (case
insensitive) and the correct form will be used for the time of year.
This module is used to good effect in module C<DateTime::US> to
get the desired time zone abbreviation in its C<.to-localtime> method.

Currently only US abbreviations are in the 'use'd B<Timezones::US>
database, but a future modification will add others (perhaps in other
languages also). PRs are welcome!
