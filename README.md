NAME
====

**LocalTime** - A wrapper of class **DateTime** with varied formatters depending on time zone entry

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use LocalTime;
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

**LocalTime** is a wrapper class holding an instance of the Raku **DateTime** class. It was created to either add a local timezone (TZ) abbreviation to a time string or show either none or other TZ information depending on the use (or non-use) of the named variable `:tz-abbrev`. Following are the formatting effects of the various input conditions:

### class DateTime

  * The default format for `DateTime`:

        $ say DateTime.new: :2024year;
        2024-01-01T00:00:00Z

### class LocalTime

  * The default format for `LocalTime` with no time zone entry:

        $ say LocalTime.new(:2024year);
        2024-01-01T00:00:00 # <== note no trailing 'Z'

  * The default format for `LocalTime` with 'CST' entered:

        $ say LocalTime.new(:2024year, :tz-abbrev<CST>);
        2024-01-01T00:00:00 CST

  * The format for `LocalTime` with a non-US TZ abbreviation entered:

        $ say LocalTime.new(:2024year, :tz-abbrev<XYT>);
        2024-01-01T00:00:00 XYT

  * The format for `LocalTime` with an empty `:tz-abbrev` named argument entered:

        $ say LocalTime.new(:2024year, :tz-abbrev);
        2024-01-01T00:00:00 Local Time (UTC -6 hrs)

Note for US TZ entries the user can enter either '*st' or '*dt' (case insensitive) and the correct form will be used for the time of year.

Currently only US abbreviations are in the 'use'd **Timezones::US** database, but a future modification will add others (perhaps in other languages also). PRs are welcome!
